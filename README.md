# Retail-Sales-Prediction


Rossman Sales Prediction data is a data set that contains historical sales data for a retail store chain. The data includes information about the store, such as Competitiors Details, type, and holidays, as well as number of the customers and sales transactions, such as the date, time, and amount of each sale.

To build a machine learning model on this data, we first gathered and clean the data, and handled the null values, then we performed indepth EDA with 15 visuals and we gathered many insights from our EDA. Then further on, we did data preprocessing.

Then we split it into training and testing sets. Next, we choose a machine learning algorithm and use the training data to train the model. Finally, you we evaluated the model's performance on the testing data to see how well it is able to predict sales.

There are many different machine learning algorithms that we used for this task, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests. It is also possible to use more advanced techniques, such as deep learning, to build a model on Rossman Sales Prediction data.

Overall, while building a machine learning model on Rossman Sales Prediction data we applied combination of data processing, machine learning techniques, and model evaluation skills. It was a challenging task, but with the right approach, we were able to create a model that can accurately predict sales for a retail store chain, and Random Forest Regression gave the best accuracy as compared to other 3 models that we trained.


## Conclusion

The Rossmann dataset is a large dataset of sales data for a chain of German pharmacies. The dataset includes over a million rows of data, with various features such as store location, type of product sold, and various sales metrics. In a machine learning project using the Rossmann dataset, you would likely start by exploring the data and trying to understand the relationships between different features and sales outcomes. You might also want to perform some data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure that the data is ready for modeling. Once you have prepared the data, you could use a variety of machine learning algorithms to build models that predict sales outcomes based on the available features. Some common approaches might include linear regression, decision trees, or random forests. You could also use more advanced techniques such as gradient boosting or neural networks whcih are beyond the scope of this present project and surely be included in future. Ultimately, the conclusion of a machine learning project using the Rossmann dataset would depend on the specific goals and objectives of the project. However, a common goal might be to build a model that is able to accurately predict sales outcomes based on the available features, and to use that model to make informed decisions about how to optimize sales and improve business performance.
